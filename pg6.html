was anyone taught the difference between .pdf or .docx files? How about learning the most common ways to fix basic computer problems? Or how to manage and navigate the space and files on your computer?

In modern "into to computer technology" classes, one would expect to learn basic computer skills, and for a computer science major, the material is absolutely "basic" computer knowledge. For a computer scientist.

However, most people who will take a intro to computers class are not computer science majors, and so learning how to code in HTML is simply not a practical skill for them. For most people, the only "practical" skill that is often taught in a computer class is learning microsoft office (excel, word, etc.)

This lack of education shows, since despite a computer class being a requirement to graduate for nearly every modern student for some time now, it can be clearly observed by anyone that most people dont really know anything about their computers or phones.

So what would be "proper" education on computers?
Real, practical information that can be used by anyone, for any device, which will allow them to better understand the possibility of their computer devices.

This essentially comes down to the argument of "should we teach code for kids, or non-CompSci students?"

https://time.com/2881453/programming-in-schools/
Time suggests that learning code at a young age, even if that person never goes on to a software career, will promote logical thinking and effective practical solving. This is NOT false, however it is misleading, as while learning code WILL promote logical problem solving, its not the only way of learning such skills, and other ways may likely involve learning more career specific skills.
(Essentially, learning code does encourage good thinking, but good thinking isnt exclusive to coding)

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2019/02/21/teaching-children-coding-waste-time-oecd-chief-says/
Accoring to this telegraph article, the educational director of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has said that learning code is simply a product of the times, and he predicts that soon technology will have progressed to a point that writing code will no longer be a practical skill.
While I dont necessarily agree that the irrelevancy of writing code is a quickly vanishing skill, I do agree that it will eventually become obsolete, in the same way that something like cursive is no longer really a vital skill.
